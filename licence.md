# Licence & Disclaimer…
The DIGGERS source code was mainly supplied for REFERENCE ONLY so people can confidently trust the projects I make with it and try to help me improve it if necessary. However, it is also public as a result so I cannot stop anyone from doing what they want with it. My hope is that if you ONLY do good things with this software, then it would be greatly appreciated if you could be as so kind as to credit me and by further considering sending a donation depending on how well this software helped you.
